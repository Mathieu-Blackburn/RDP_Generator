# RDP_Generator
RDP_Generator used to create RDP config files for students.

**The project was a team effort for a DevOps class.**

Simply build the project and you can run it off the .exe plain and simple.

With this program, you can import CSV files containing 'usernames' and 'full addresses' uppon which you can add an RDP configuration.
The program has a default RDP config, but you can customize is any way you want and save templates for later if need be.
You can also add 'usernames' and 'full addresses' manually for last minute inclusions.

With all of this, you can make RDP configs in bulk and save a lot of time.
